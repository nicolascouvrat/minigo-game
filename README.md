# MiniGo 9*9 Go game client

MiniGo is a simple java application that allows up to two people to play the game of Go (on a 9*9 grid) together on the same computer. 
This is my first real programming project, that was realized from January to May 2016 as part of a school project. The whole project was done alone, using java and the Eclipse IDE.

## Release

A release is available, featuring two player and single player mode, along with basic game functionalities (rules, end game point management system ...)
